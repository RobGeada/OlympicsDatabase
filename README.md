# OlympicsDatabase

I was frustrated that there were no easily accessible databases of Olympic results from history, so I created this tool to trawl sports-reference.com and create that database. It generates a csv of medal results for every sport and discipline in Olympic history, not included results from the current Olympics (2016). 

###Usage
Simply place the python script and `sports.html` into a directory, then run the python program. `sports.html` seeds the trawler with a list of Olympic sports as of 8/14/2016.
